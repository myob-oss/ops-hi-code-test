# Technical Test

## App Details

Your application should be written in Python using Flask. It should provide a single REST API endpoint and provides the following:

* an endpoint that returns data accessed via the Github API. Using the Github API return all members of an organisation and show the member with the highest number of followers.
    * The returned data should be JSON formatted.
    * Example organisation endpoint: https://api.github.com/orgs/MYOB-Technology/members
    * Note: The Github API has an unauthenticated rate limit of 60 requests per hour.
* we would like to see some examples of appropriate testing for a subset of the application.

## Fit and Finish

Once the application has been written, continue with the following additions:

* provide a link to your git repo, we’d like to see your commits to show your development process.
* describe or show how you would deploy this application
* describe or demonstrate any risks associated with your application/deployment
* write a clear and understandable README which explains your application, how to run it, and how it aligns with the listed requirements
